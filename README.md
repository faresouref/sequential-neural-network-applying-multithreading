# Machine Learning GUI using Tkinter and Keras

## Overview

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for machine learning tasks, specifically for training and evaluating neural network models using Keras and scikit-learn. The GUI allows users to load their dataset, preprocess it, train models in parallel threads, and evaluate them using various metrics.

## Features

- **Dataset Loading:** Load dataset from a CSV file
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess data using StandardScaler
- **Parallel Processing:** Train neural network models in parallel threads
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- **Cross-Validation:** Perform cross-validation for additional evaluation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `tkinter`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `keras`
